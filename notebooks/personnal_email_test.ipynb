This way they will identify the group of deal that they want to analyse first to find its Root cause  \\t*\\tMethod 2 : One first root cause identified, sometime we are able to identify the deals that are associated to this RC.

[Sarah] : only services. But if the clustering prove it¬ís efficiency on very big data and we able to simplify it¬ís usage by BAs the business model can change.      *\tIf the clustering tool didn¬ít exist, would the BAs analyse each line one by one ? What is the standard methods used when they don¬ít have the clustering tool to accelerate they work?  [Sarah] : no the BA wont do line by line. They will combine 2 methodes :   \t*\tMethod 1: cluster by human brain. BAs will be able to identify patterns on limited number of columns ( 5 for exemple) however the brain limitation will prevent then to do it on 100 columns. That¬ís where ML clustering is bringing added value.  This way they will identify the group of deal that they want to analyse first to find its Root cause  \t*\tMethod 2 : One first root cause identified, sometime we are able to identify the deals that are associated to this RC. Eg. All the deals on curr EUR will have a problem because EUR currency is wrongly configured in the system. Then the BA can already query these deals and tag their mismatch to the RC newly identified.      *\tAs a BA, if you found most of the root causes on a specific source target murex version (MX3.xx to MX3.yy for instance), can you reuse this knowledge on other versions (for instance MX3.aa to MX3.bb) ?  [Sarah] : not that strait forward. Some expected behaviour change yes. Other RC that are bugs to be corrected or specific bank use cases are not that easy to reuse.      *\tSame question but in the case where MX2.dd to MX3.tt  [Sarah]: same answer           Thanks  Sarah         question uRecon business case     Hi Sarah,     Here are some questions about why you are using uRecon. Our aim is to fully understand the need behind and maybe propose a new approach based on this understanding (our feeling with George is that using Fuzzy ART is very complex, and we do not see any obvious explanation of this complexity). My questions mainly focus on the BA¬ís work. I also sometime write what I understood, please correct me if I mis-understood something.     *\tWhat is sold to the customer ? -> the explanation (the root cause) of each mismatch detected between the 2 versions of Murex *\tIs the clustering tool also sold or only the service associated with it ? *\tIf the clustering tool didn¬ít exist, would the BAs analyse each line one by one ?

Emphasize the important of data aggregation solution & 100% deals for 6 banks (inclusive of HSBC) to be stored successfully in the database either via full/semi auto by end of June. Saim, Sentil, George team to closely track.   2. Decide database structure, either relationship db or non-SQL Dynamo -> Saim to setup a separate meeting with Dinesh, Wilson and Upskills team to discuss and confirm the approach. Latest by 31 May 2019.  3. Fast-track 1 bank (complete extracting & storing 100% of the deals by mid June, proposed the ¬ëeasiest¬í bank) -> George to revert the bank by mid week.   4. Google API to extract merchants info -> George¬ís team to analyse further and revert (cost and scope) by EOW.  5. SCB API -> Saim to setup a separate meeting with George¬ís team, Dinesh and SCB CMS team in CBP. By 31 May 2019  6. Screen for new/update/delete of deals changes in the DB. Detail to be further discussed.    7. Extraction of the fine-print/T&C into the database. Detail to be further discussed.    8. Operating Model with Upskills ¬ñ Starts with once a week (every Monday) based in SCB. Meet up in SCB as and when required.

However, I need all the banks ¬ípromotions/deals to be in our database by end June 2019. Please also consider the option of fast-tracking 1 bank (probably the easier 1) for a quick-win to show-case to the senior management while working on other banks in parallel.
